### General

These general terms and conditions (GTC) apply to the contractual relationship between the company Virtual Style Companion, hereinafter referred to as the "Provider," and private consumers, hereinafter referred to as "Customers." They also govern the conditions for using purchased vouchers for services and adhering to appointments by the authorized holders and customers.

### Conclusion of Contract

The contract is concluded by the Provider's offer and the Customer's acceptance. The Customer accepts the offer by scheduling a consultation appointment. In the case of online consultations, the Customer accepts the offer by making the payment. In the case of orders for service vouchers, the confirmation of the voucher order by the Provider constitutes the conclusion of the contract.

Acceptance by the Provider does not require a specific form; it is done in the case of electronic offers by a confirmation email, otherwise by oral or telephonic confirmation or by scheduling the appointment.

The provided consultation services are services. Therefore, there is no warranty right. If the Customer is not satisfied with the result, there is no right to a refund after the service has been rendered.

### Conditions of Performance

The basis for providing services are customer-specific offers with service descriptions and price information, which are usually communicated via email but can also be communicated orally, by telephone, in writing, or electronically. By scheduling an appointment, paying for online offers, or ordering vouchers for services, the Customer accepts the content of the offer.

### Appointment Scheduling

Scheduling an appointment by the Customer constitutes acceptance of an individual offer by the Customer. If a cancellation or postponement of the appointment is required by the Customer, this must be communicated in a timely manner, at least 7 calendar days before the appointment. Otherwise, the Provider is entitled to charge the Customer 25% of the agreed service cost for the resulting loss of earnings.

### Payment Conditions

Payment for online services is due after invoicing and before the consultation. Payment for offline services, goods, or immediately issued gift vouchers is due – unless otherwise agreed – immediately after the service is rendered or the voucher is purchased, in cash. Vouchers for consulting services purchased remotely are sent free of charge within Germany and Romania to the email address specified by the Customer and are invoiced. The invoice is payable by bank transfer within 10 calendar days of receipt without any deduction. Voucher dispatch generally occurs after receipt of payment.

### Use of Vouchers

Vouchers for services are not value vouchers but relate to a specifically agreed individual service according to the Customer's wishes. Therefore, they can only be used for the specified services. Vouchers for services are valid for one year. If no validity period is specified on the vouchers, they are valid for 3 years from the date of issue. After the expiration period, the Provider is entitled to refuse acceptance of the voucher. Cash payouts or subsequent changes to the contractually agreed services are only possible by mutual agreement. Vouchers for services are generally transferable, with the specified service description in the offer remaining unchanged. Refunds from vouchers are excluded. To use the voucher service, an appointment must be scheduled with the Provider. The appointment can be arranged by email, orally, by telephone, or in writing.

### Liability Insurance

The Provider maintains business liability insurance.

### Jurisdiction

The law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies. The place of performance is Berlin. The agreed jurisdiction for all contracts is Berlin.

### Right of Withdrawal for Consumers

**Right of Withdrawal**

You have the right to withdraw from this contract within fourteen days without giving any reason. The withdrawal period is fourteen days from the day you or a third party named by you, who is not the carrier, have taken possession of the goods. To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must inform Virtual Style Companion, virtualstylecompanion@tuta.com of your decision to withdraw from this contract by means of a clear declaration (e.g., a letter sent by post, fax, or email). You can use the attached model withdrawal form, but it is not mandatory. To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.

**Consequences of Withdrawal**

If you withdraw from this contract, we will reimburse all payments received from you, including the delivery costs (except for the additional costs arising if you chose a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and at the latest within fourteen days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement. We may withhold reimbursement until we have received the goods back or you have supplied evidence of having sent back the goods, whichever is the earliest. You shall send back the goods or hand them over to us without undue delay and in any event not later than fourteen days from the day on which you communicate your withdrawal from this contract to us. The deadline is met if you send back the goods before the period of fourteen days has expired. You will have to bear the direct cost of returning the goods.

### Online Dispute Resolution

We do not participate in a dispute resolution procedure before a consumer arbitration board.
